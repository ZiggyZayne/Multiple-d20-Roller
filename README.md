# Multiple-d20-Roller
Select a number between 1 and 60, hit roll, and your d20s are rolled! Hit reset to refresh the page to roll again.

Very basic HTML, CSS, and JS. The only really cool thing about this whole thing to me is the use of the decrementing for loop that pulls the info from the number input to call the dice roller function that many times. This was a great learning project for me!
